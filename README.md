# COS30008 Data Structures and Patterns

## About This Unit
COS30008 â€“ Data Structures and Patterns studies the design, implementation, and application of data structures as a means for algorithmic problem solving. Each problem exhibits specific characteristics with respect to resource requirements, data representation, and software architecture. 

Learning outcomes:
- Solve problems using object oriented design and implementation techniques.
- Interpret the trade-offs and issues involved in the design, implementation, and application of various data structures with respect to a given problem.
- Design, implement, and evaluate software solutions using behavioural, creational, and structural software design patterns.
- Explain the purpose and answer questions about data structures and design patterns that illustrate strengths and weaknesses with respect to resource consumption.
- Assess the impact of data structures on algorithms.
- Evaluate algorithm designs and perform best-, average-, and worst-case analysis.
