# COS30008 Data Structures and Patterns

## About This Unit
COS30008 – Data Structures and Patterns study the design, implementation, and application of data structures as a means for algorithmic problem-solving. Each problem exhibits specific characteristics concerning resource requirements, data representation, and software architecture. 

Learning outcomes:
- Solve problems using object-oriented design and implementation techniques.
- Interpret the trade-offs and issues involved in the design, implementation, and application of various data structures for a given problem.
- Design, implement, and evaluate software solutions using behavioral, creational, and structural software design patterns.
- Explain the purpose and answer questions about data structures and design patterns that illustrate strengths and weaknesses for resource consumption.
- Assess the impact of data structures on algorithms.
- Evaluate algorithm designs and perform best-, average-, and worst-case analyses.

## Directories in this Repository
- **Problem Set 1: Solution Design in C++:**
Extending previous solutions to calculate a polygon’s signed area, determine a polynomial’s properties, and explore Bernstein polynomials for Bézier curves.

- **Problem Set 2: Indexers, Method Overriding, and Lambdas:**
Creating an integer vector class, then based on it, implementing Bubble Sort and Cocktail Shaker Sort.

- **Problem Set 3: List Abstract Data Type:**
Reviewing and implementing classes for a List Abstract Data Type (ADT), using the DoublyLinkedList and DoublyLinkedListIterator classes as a foundation. 

- **Problem Set 4: Binary Search Trees & In-Order Traversal:**
The implementation of a BinaryTreeNode class, a BinarySearchTree class, and an iterator for the in-order traversal of a binary search tree.

- **Mid-Term Test:**
The Vigenère Cipher in the domain of cryptography, covers key representation, encoding and decoding processes, object adapters, and iterators. 

- **Final Test:**
Defining a generic 3-ary tree in C++, named TernaryTree, which includes a payload key and an array to store 3-ary subtrees.
